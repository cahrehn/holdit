# Hold It!
A reservation system

### Context
We are designing and building an online restaurant reservation system for a popular restaurant in Manhattan. Restaurants operate on thin margins and they rely on reservation system info to help accurately plan and optimize their food and ingredients purchases. Our service will help them do that.

* Create an API endpoint for creating reservations that allows the API consumer to specify the following attributes:
    1. party size
    1. reservation date
    1. reservation slot
    1. party name
    1. contact phone
    1. contact email address.
* Create an API endpoint for listing all reservations at the restaurant. The API consumer should be able to filter based on reservation attributes:
    1. party size
    1. reservation date
    1. reservation slot
    1. party name
    1. contact phone
    1. contact email address
* Provide documentation that describes how to build and run your code, and include sample API payloads.
* Your code is well-tested.
* The reservation creation endpoint should account for the constraint that table capacity in a restaurant is limited.
